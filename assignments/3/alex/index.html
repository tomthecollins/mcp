						<h2>WILD - Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming</h2>
					</header>
					<p> The Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming technique involves keeping the mind active while the body is shutting down. This technique is very popular and is considered to be the best method to use. This technique involves allowing yourself to go into what is known as ‘Sleep Paralysis.’ Sleep paralysis is a state in which your body has shut down for sleep, but you are still awake mentally. This particular state is scary for some people, but the idea behind it is that you can avoid having to perform reality checks which is another important technique which I will cover on this page. Since you are awake and your body is sleeping, you are now able to move into a dream state with complete awareness if you remain focused. In my own personal experience with this technique, it has been difficult since I believe you need to have a strong grasp on how to meditate and with this, you can remain focused on the task at hand without letting any outside stimulus distract you.
  To perform WILD you need to follow these steps.</p>
<p>1 - Review Lucid dreaming material one hour before bed: This includes reading the experiences of others, reading dreams you have recorded or and simply focusing your mind on the idea of lucid dreaming for an hour. This step follows right into sleeping so you should not perform any other tasks after starting this step. This means no eating, no using your phone, and no TV.
(Overall, not a bad way to spend the last hour of the day).</p>
<p>2 - Step 2 involves relaxing the body. Starting at your feet, tense up a section of your body and then release the tension slowly. Focus on parts of your body that feel most tense. After completing a section the body part should remain limp for this point on until your body is limp.
<p>3 - Focus on deep breathing and your heartbeat. Remember to remain motionless except for the movements of your breath. Then relax your breathing and lower your heart rate. You should spend about 10-20 minutes on this step.
<p>4 - With your eyes closed and your body relaxed is to imagine a circle. From there, make the circle clearer then make it disappear. Repeat this with other shapes. Once you get the hang of this, start augmenting the size of the image. At the point, you can begin to imagine a setting your mind such as a field or forest. The image will seem to create itself so go with it and don’t try to control the setting, but hold onto the image once you have one that you are comfortable with.
<p>5 - Now imagine yourself in the setting created. Aim for a first-person view by beginning to look down at your hands or feet. Acknowledge things like the temperature, wind, rain, or any other physical sensations. You are now in a dream and should tell this to your out loud. You are in complete control of the dream and only need to remain calm.
<p>Notes: Take baby steps when it comes to lucid dreaming. Try to create random objects appear and then interact with them. Then go a bit further by trying to teleport or fly. You can do this in any way you can imagine, the dream is only limited by your expectation. The last thing to try when you feel ready is making a person appear and trying to talk to them. There is a lot that dreams have to offer at this point since talking to someone else is really you talking to your own subconscious and there is the opportunity to find out new things about yourself or bring unresolved issues to a conclusion.

						<h2>FILD - Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming</h2>
<p>FILD (Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming) 

  FILD is a technique that is supposed to induce lucid dreaming within 5-30 seconds. You must be very sleepy when attempting this technique. It is a great technique, but may not be suitable for beginners since it may not work and may cause a lack of confidence in your lucid dreaming capabilities even though anyone can lucid dream. With that said, here are the steps to using FILD. 

<p></p>1 - Make sure you are very tired, to the point that when you head hits the pillow you will fall asleep soon after. This can be achieved by doing a lot of exercising the day you wish to attempt FILD. 

<p></p>2 - You'll need to practice the following. Before attempting this technique you need to practice finger movements. Being to move your index and middle finger interchangeably. It is helpful to imagine that you are playing the piano. Continue this and begin to use less force to move your fingers. A good way to practice this is to put your hands on your keyboard and move your fingers just enough where they dip down, but do not press the keys all the way down. You want to continue this until you have are barely moving your fingers, but can still feel that your muscles are contracting to move them. This feeling is what you are going to need to use this technique. 

<p></p>3- Just go to sleep and wake up at a time you are going to be tired such as the middle of the night. When you wake up, do not think about anything just focus on your fingers and perform the movements. Whether or not your fingers are actually moving is not important for this technique, but the feeling that you are sending a signal to your fingers is what we are aiming for. Do this for 30 seconds without thinking or doing anything else. 

<p></p>4- From here you should have moved into the lucid dreaming world, but if you haven’t don’t worry! Just give it another try in an hour.  </p>

						<h2>HILD -  Hypnosis Induced Lucid Dreaming</h2>
                            <p>HILD involves self-hypnosis by deep-relaxation. This technique is not as time consuming as others, but as a consequence, it is not as easy to achieve.
The steps for HILD are as follows:
<p></p>1 - First you need to bring yourself to a state of deep relaxation. The best way to do this is to wake up 2 hours earlier than you normally do. In order to reach deep-relaxation use contraction and relaxation. Starting at the toes breath in and curl up your toes then exhale and release the tension in your toes. Repeat this with sections of your body moving up from your toes. Your body should feel heavier while your mind is clear and at this point, you will have entered a trance.
<p></p>2 - Now you should use positive affirmations such as “I am going to lucid dream” or “I’m entering a dream and when I do I will be at the park.” Since you are in a trance your mind is open to suggestion and the next step will take advantage of this.
<p></p>3 - Start to suggest things to yourself like “Every number I count between 1 and 100 will bring me one step closer to lucid dreaming.” It is important to know that you are going to enter your lucid dream in an unstable state so you should do your best to remain calm. In your dream, you should say out loud “stabilize” in order to gain control. Other useful tools are to spin around in a circle or to perform reality checks which I will discuss in more detail in another section.

						<h2>MILD - Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams</h2>
<p>This is a fairly short technique that can be used to induce lucid dreaming. It is great for beginners and takes advantage of the power of affirmation as we have seen in other techniques. This technique involves a lot of steps that are meant to be done throughout the day and right before bed along with steps that take place after waking up.
The steps for MILD are as follows:
<p></p>1 -  Although dream recall is important for any technique, it is especially important for MILD. In another section, I will cover dream recall with more detail, but for now, understand that writing down your dreams after they happen is important and that is how we can improve dream recall. We’ll need these dreams to help us point out recurring events.
<p></p>2 - Perform a reality check. This can be anything you want it to be, but it has to be something you can easily do and remember. Things such as looking at the time twice to see if it remains the same, reading something twice to see if the words change or poking your hand to see if your finger goes through it. These are all common examples of reality checks and I will cover more on reality checks in another section.
<p></p>3 - Throughout the day and before going to bed, use your lucid dream affirmations. This can be anything you want as long as it is positive. Things like “I’m going to lucid dream tonight” or “I am a lucid dreamer” are good affirmations. The point of these affirmations is to build confidence in yourself so the more you believe in them the better.
<p></p>4 - As you are trying to go to bed and using your affirmations you have to imagine the dream you want to have. This is much like the end of the WILD technique, but what is important for a beginner using MILD is to simply visualize a setting and imagine themselves there. If everything is a success you will have walk into a dream with full awareness.

						<h2>DILD - Dream Induced Lucid Dreams</h2>
<p>DILD is a random event. In the past, it may have happened to you where you just randomly realize you are in a dream for one reason or another. In my opinion, this is less of a technique and more of just luck. Nonetheless, it does involve important techniques for anybody trying to lucid dream. When it comes to DILD I would not aim for this to happen because the goal should be to have control and be aware of your environment. With that said, here are the things you can do to increase the chance of DILD.
<p></p>1 - Writing down your dreams and looking for recurring signs.
<p></p>2 - Performing reality checks throughout the day.
<p></p>3 - Using meditation to increase your awareness. This tip is two-fold since it is also useful in self-relaxation with other techniques.
<p></p>4 - Binaural beats which can be found anywhere for free especially on Youtube. It is simply playing two different frequencies in each ear. Different frequencies are known to evoke different brain states so a frequency that promotes calm awareness is typically used.

						<h2>Reality Checks!</h2>
<p>Reality checks are a simple, but important technique in order to evoke awareness while dreaming. It is exactly as it sounds, you need to devise a way to determine if you are in real waking life or if you are in a dream. Typically we have dreams and agree that the dream is real life until we wake up and realize certain things that were strange. The purpose of reality checks is to get into the habit of questionings things that seem strange or unlikely. Things such as seeing someone who lives very far away, seeing something that is unphysical, or noticing a lack of continuity. Performing a reality check is easy and quick to do. You should avoid reality checks that can only be performed in certain situations such as stomping your feet to make the ground shake. That can be strange to do in public so the goal should be to have a discrete, but an effective reality check. A few common choices are as follows.
<p></p>1 - Poke your palm to see if your finger goes through it.
<p></p>2 - Check the time twice  to see if it changes unexpectedly.
<p></p>3 - Read something short twice to see if the words change.
<p></p>4 - Close your nose and mouth then try to breathe.

						<h2>The Importance of Dream Journals</h2>
<p>Dream Journals are another simple task that can make a big difference in your ability to become aware while dreaming. The major reason for using a dream journal is to increase dream recall and your overall awareness. Aside from this, dream journals are very helpful for determining a lucid dreaming queue. It is different for everyone, but essentially it is a reoccurring event in your dreams that you have been able to identify. Since knowing is half the battle, next time you see this event, person, or thing, you will know to check if you are in a dream or not. There are a couple of helpful steps to properly keeping a dream journal. 

<p></p>1- Keep your book close to you when you go to bed with a pen or pencil ready to go. If you move too much or do other things after waking up, you will most likely forget the dream. 

<p></p>2- You want to stay away from writing in the past tense. Write about the dream as if it is currently happening. Also, keep the date of each of your dreams so you can tell how often you dream or how many dreams you have a night. 

<p></p>3- Review your dreams at another time and determine recurring events, people, or things. For myself, a recurring event is not being able to open my eyes all the way. Underline all these things in your book and refer to them often so you can be aware to look out for them later. 

<p></p>4- Do not waste your time with grammar or punctuation. You want to get the main points of the dream so you can then recreate the images in your mind. The overall goal is just to have it make enough sense for yourself. It helps to include images that stick out to in a dream. Keep in mind it is not important for any of this to look nice, so just do what is within your own ability. 

<p></p>5- After writing down your dream there are two last things to do. Keep a note of anything that you are dealing with that may be causing stress in your life or anything that is that is good in your life. The purpose of this is to later help you identify unconscious dream symbols that may be connected to real life events. Lastly, give your dream a title so you can remember it more easily and be sure to label a dream that you became lucid in.
